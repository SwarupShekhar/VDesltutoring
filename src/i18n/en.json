Traditional courses respond by adding more grammar, more rules, and more words. This increases mental load - and makes speaking even harder. Fluency doesn’t break because of ignorance. It breaks because of cognitive overload under pressure."

That’s why people who study for years still freeze when a real human speaks to them."
